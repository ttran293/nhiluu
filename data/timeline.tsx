      "Around May 2021, I applied for an internship offer at Media Cybernetics. While studying as a full-time student,  I pursued my first hands-on experience as a software developer. Eventually, I received a full-time offer at Media Cybernetics after completing my academic degree. My work surrounds microscopy cameras and image analysis. Specifically, I am involved in maintaining and developing capture interfaces connecting microscopy camera drivers and the company's main application. Furthermore, I also work on PowerBI visualizing the cameras data usage thank to the courses I took at UMBC. The visualizations help illustrate the cameras' manufacturer,  the users' habits. This ultimately contributes to many of the company's marketing strategies.",
